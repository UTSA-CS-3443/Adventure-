At program start
----------------

Load the hashmap locMap with Location Objects pointed to by the LOC <string> for each location in the file

Load the initial screen (for new games, the default screen. For loading games, whatever screen we were last on).
		- This will require a call to, say, a LoadLocation.java which will be passed a location object
		
		public <returntype> loadLocation(Location location)
		{
			this method or class will be responsible for loading the new location to the screen
		}
		
		
		public <returntype> readLocations("file of locations")
		{
			while reading each line in the file
				String attr[128] = null;
				String name = null;
				String desc = null;
				String up = null;
				String down = null;
				String left = null;
				String right = null;
				so on
				
				
				read name
				read desc
				read up
				so on
				
				
				Location location = new Location();
