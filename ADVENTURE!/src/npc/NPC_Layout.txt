To create NPCs for a custom adventure, follow this format

NPC>name>type
DESC>"description here"
SPEECH>"NPC dialogue here"
MERCHANT>0 or 1
IMG>img_name.jpg
INV>item>cost
ENDNPC>

Notes:
- You may repeat INV>item>cost as many times as you wish to add more items
- MERCHANT sets whether or the character sells item. 1 meaning yes, 0 meaning no
- You may currently add items to a non MERCHANT character, but this is not advisable. Doing so
would allow players to buy items but not see what they are buying. The only time an item should be added to
a non MERCHANT character is for InnKeeper types.
- If you want an InnKeeper to allow players to sleep at an inn, set MERCHANT to 0 and add INV>Inn Room>cost
	- resting at an inn fully heals the player.
- Currently, the only types of NPCs are ShopKeeper and InnKeeper
