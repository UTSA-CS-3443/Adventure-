To create your own Events for a custom adventure, follow this format

EVENT>event_name
DESC>"description of event"
CHOICE>choice_name>result(s)
ENDEVENT>

Notes:
- You may add as many CHOICE options as you want
- multiple results must follow this format
	result~result~result~etc.
- results rely on the following keywords
	HP, ROLL, STR, PER, INT, AGI, LUC, MON (Health, Skill Check, Strength, Perception, Intelligence, Agility, Luck, Money)
- Examples of results:
	HP - 3
	HP - 3~ROLL AGI 10~HP +3  // If the player fails to roll a 20 sided die + their agility modifier resulting in a 10 or higher
								 they lose 3 health, otherwise they don't take damage.
	STR + 1
	MON - 5~ROLL LUC 15~MON + 10
	ROLL STR 8~MON + 3
