Locations
	- Establish all of the locations that we will be using (locations package)
	- Establish all of the events that a location could have (events package)
			Does the location have the chance to spawn treasure?, etc.
	- Establish all of the world attributes a location could have (worldattribute package)
			Is this location very hot, perhaps to the point where it hurts the user over time?
			
			
Controller
	- Fully implement the new Game class which will initialize the game
	- Fully implement all of our screens
	- Implement a way to display the images of a particular location on screen based on the name of the location
