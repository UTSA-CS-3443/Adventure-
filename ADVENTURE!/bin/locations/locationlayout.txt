To create your own Locations for a custom adventure, follow this format

LOC>Location name
DESC>"description of the location"
NORTH>location or NPC name
SOUTH>location or NPCname
EAST>location or NPC name
WEST>location or NPC name
EVENT>event name
ENDLOC>

Note: you may (and should) omit some parts of the location if you don't want/need to use them.
Example:
LOC>Front of a White House
DESC>"There is a mailbox here."
NORTH>Inside White House
EAST>Dirt Road
ENDLOC>

If you were to add other cardinal directions with a blank or without a corresponding location or NPC, the
game would display buttons for them, but if there is no location object (created when LOC> is read) or NPC matching the button,
the game will attempt to update the screen resulting in the player being placed in an unescapeable "location" with no buttons 
to get back.
